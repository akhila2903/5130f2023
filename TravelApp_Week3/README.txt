This week, I did some cool stuff in our TravelApp Frontend by creating HotelImages and Finalprice components using React. First off, I implemented a HotelImages component that allows users to click on a hotel from the home page and explore all its images, providing a more detailed and visual understanding of the accommodations.It makes the app more fun and helps users get a better idea of where they might want to stay.
Moreover, I've added the Hotel Final Price component to include factors such as check-in and check-out time duration, as well as the number of guests. Now, when users check out a hotel, the final price is tailored to their specific dates and group size, offering a more personalized and transparent cost estimation. These enhancements aim to streamline the booking process, offering users greater clarity and flexibility.
