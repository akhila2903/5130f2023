This week, I made significant progress in enhancing the user interface of my application by implementing the SearchItem component using React and modular CSS. I have also worked on List page for searching and displaying accommodation options. It interacts with the SearchItem component to present a user-friendly interface.The component efficiently organizes and displays detailed information about accommodation options, leveraging React's component-based structure for clarity and maintainability. 
The component structure includes an image, details about the accommodation such as title, distance from the center, free airport taxi service, description, features, cancellation options, and additional details like rating, price, and a button to check availability.The component's design is visually appealing and user-friendly, providing key details such as ratings, price, and availability at a glance.
