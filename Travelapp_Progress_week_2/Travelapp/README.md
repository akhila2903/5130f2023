# TravelApp

This week, I did some cool stuff on my React app! So far, I've got the basics like login and register pages set up. But the big win is the new "Places" page I made. This page is like the go-to spot for info on a hotel, showing everything - from amenities to what's available.I'm super proud of this because it makes the app way more user-friendly. People can easily check out a hotel's details before booking, which is awesome. I focused on the look and feel of the app using React to make it visually nice and easy to use.

Additionally, I've made progress on the account page, where users can seamlessly add new hotels to the application. This not only contributes to the app's content but also empowers users to actively engage with the platform. The account page also provides a convenient way to view their bookings and manage their profiles, adding another layer of functionality to the application.
I haven't started on the backend yet; I wanted to get the front part solid first. But next up, I'll be working on the backend to make everything run smoothly.
