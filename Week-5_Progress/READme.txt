This week, I added a cool new feature to the Travel App called "SearchStayWithDate.This component is designed to make it super easy for users to find the perfect stay by allowing them to specify specific dates for their travel plans. With "SearchStayWithDate," users can now input the dates they plan to check in and check out, ensuring that the app displays accommodations available during that specific timeframe. 
This feature adds a layer of convenience and precision to the travel planning process, allowing users to tailor their search results to match their exact dates, making the overall experience more personalized and efficient.
Also, I created a special folder called "DateContext Provider" to keep important details like where you're going, the number of guests, and the dates you're checking in and out. This makes the app work better and helps users plan their trips more smoothly.
